# A symlink (symbolic link) is like a shortcut or pointer to another file.
# It lets you access a file (like .env) from a different location without copying it.
# Useful for sharing a single config file across folders, e.g., app/.env â†’ ../.env
# when you make changes in that it also change in that file which is linked
